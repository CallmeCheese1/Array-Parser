# Array Parser

## Description
This project is a C++ program that uses dynamic pointer-based arrays to parse input from a text file and perform four functions:

- A function to check if a certain integer exists in the array if the number is present return the index where the number is present.
- A function that can modify the value of an integer when called with the index of the integer in the array and return the new value and old value back to the user.
- A function that adds a new integer to the end of the array
- A function which intakes an index of an array and replaces the value with either 0 or removes the integer altogether.

## Files
- `main.cpp`: Contains the main function and test code.
- `arrayparser.h`: Header file with function declarations.
- `arrayparser.cpp`: Implementation of functions declared in `arrayparser.h`.
- `data.txt`: Input file for reading data.

## Usage
- Compile the project with your preferred C++ compiler.
- Run the executable to see the program in action.
